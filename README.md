# MEASUREMENT PROBLEMS
What are the reasons that make people buy? First of all we talk about 'social proof'. Especially last 10 year, the Wisdom of Crowds get more important. If Mehmet selects two mouses and one of them have 4 other one has 5 stars. But if 4 star one have rated by higher amount of people, most of us will choose low star but high number of rating.
Making these social proof reliable, companys should choose and develop these carrefuly;
Product Rating point calc.
Product listing order
Product commend listing order
Product pages (main and selling) visual design.
Testing feature changes on website or app to make better updates.
Testing probable action and reactions. (If I take action like that, what will be the customers respond to that?)
Methods for measureing these metrics;
